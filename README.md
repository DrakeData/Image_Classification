# Image Classification
This repository will be creating a image recognition model by using the Kaggle dogs vs. cats classification problem.

## Overview
This repository is for MSDS 422 and will be looking at the [Dogs vs. Cats data set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/overview).

The Dogs vs. Cats dataset is a standard computer vision dataset that involves classifying photos as either containing a dog or cat.

## Notebooks
- [Image_Classification_Main.ipynb](https://github.com/DrakeData/Image_Classification/blob/main/Image_Classification_Main.ipynb): This is a Colab notebook that will house the code for MSDS 422 Assignment 8.

## Assignment Overview
- Assignment 8: Conduct EDA, build 3 CNN models based on hyperparameter tuning, evaluate goodness of fit metrics, make prediction on test data and send results to Kaggle.
